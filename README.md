## ISO Builder

This ISO builder is fork of the good work from the elementary crew.  Many thanks to the devs there https://github.com/elementary/os

## Building Locally

As Ubuntu Sway is built with the Debian version of live-build, not the Ubuntu patched version, it's easiest to build an Ubuntu Sway .iso in a Debian VM or container. This prevents messing up your host system too.

The following example uses Docker and assumes you have Docker correctly installed and set up:

Clone this project & cd into it:

    git clone https://github.com/Ubuntu-Sway/iso-builder && cd iso-builder

Configure the channel in the etc/terraform.conf (unstable, stable).

Run the build:

    docker run --privileged -i -v /proc:/proc \
        -v ${PWD}:/working_dir \
        -w /working_dir \
        debian:latest \
        /bin/bash -s etc/terraform.conf < build.sh

Build Raspberry Pi image:

    docker run --privileged -i -v /proc:/proc \
        -v ${PWD}:/working_dir \
        -w /working_dir \
        ubuntu:22.04 \
        ./build-rpi.sh


When done, your image will be in the builds folder.
